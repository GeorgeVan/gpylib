1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,340
So,to make a long story short,

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,310
they say it's my fault for leaving
the pistolon the seat of the Jeep.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,710
I say it's the general's
fault for sitting on it.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,550
But either way,I'm not allowed
to have a gun for a while.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,110
And a weary nation
breathes a sigh of relief.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,410
Yeah,yeah,terrific.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,030
Um,so,they've got you
working in the kitchen?

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,450
Yeah,we call it the mess.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,080
That corn's not gonna
cream itself,Harper!

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,650
Yes,sir. Sorry,sir.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,650
Uh,I got to go back to workdefending our
nation against terrorists and what not.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,980
Take care of yourself,buddy.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,170
Don't worry,Dad.I'm being all I can be.

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Seems like just yesterday
he was an adorable,

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,750
chubby-cheeked little boy catching a
Frisbeeon the beach in Santa Monica.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,440
Now he's a fuzz-faced buck privatecatching
the clap from a whore in Tijuana.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,620
Hey,guys.What do you think?

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,990
Oh,yummy.

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,010
You look like the maitre d' in heaven.

20
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,400
What's the occasion?

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,510
It's Zoey's birthday.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,590
Oh,well,tell her happy
birthday.What are you gonna give her?

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,930
The rest of my life.

24
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,190
Beg your pardon?

25
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,610
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

26
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,460
Hello. Are you serious?

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,820
Absolutely.

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,470
Wow,wow,that's,uh...

29
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,730
What he's trying to say
is,once you're married,

30
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,250
where's he gonna live?

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,160
No,no,stop,please.No,what
I'm trying to say is,

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,760
I think it's wonderful,and
I'm very happy for you.

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,450
I figured,why not,you know?I
mean,I love her,I love her daughter.

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,200
Yeah,it's win-win for everybody.

35
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,590
Gonna miss you.

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,390
Hey,I don't want to get ahead of myself,

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,930
but I was hoping you'd be my best man.

38
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,970
Oh,uh,Walden,I'd be honored to
be the best man at your wedding.

39
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,270
What's so funny?

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,380
You wouldn't be the best man
at the Dinah Shore Golf Classic.

41
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,750
All right,you can be the maid of honor.

42
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,280
Okay,I got to go.

43
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,960
Good luck with Zoey.

44
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,460
Oh,thanks,but I mean,come on.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,230
How about that?The
kid's getting married.

46
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,780
Yeah. Crazy,huh?

47
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,430
If I looked like him,I wouldn't
take myself off the market.

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,350
Is that so?

49
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,170
Oh,yeah,I'd be out there every
nightwearing my penis down to a nub.

50
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,640
It would look like a golf pencil.

51
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,790
Hey,a golf pencil does
a lot of scoring,lady.

Changed My Mind About the Milk

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,900
This is magnificent.

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,410
As are you.

58
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,530
Happy birthday.

59
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,800
Thank you.

60
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:30,560
Zoey,my life is so much
better with you in it.

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,450
The first time I saw
you,it was like...fireworks.

62
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,850
- Did you...
- I did.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,950
And when I hear your voice...

64
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,740
...it's like music.

65
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,390
Music.

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,700
Sorry.

67
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,190
Oh,God,Walden,all this for my birthday?

68
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,820
Not just for your birthday.

69
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:19,490
You see,Zoey,when a man loves a woman...

70
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,120
...he can't keep his
mind on nothin' else.

71
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,210
Okay,I'm totally lost now.

72
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,710
He'd give up all his comforts

73
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,600
and sleep out in the rain,

74
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,540
if she said that's
the way it ought to be.

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,790
Wait,that's from some song.

76
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,730
No,no,not some song;a great song.

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,510
Bolton,you're up.

78
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,060
* When a man loves a woman *

79
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,910
* He can't keep his
mind on nothin' else *

80
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,830
* He'd trade the world... *

81
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,190
Get up,get up.Stop it.

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,730
Zoey Hyde-Tottingham Pierce...

83
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:13,570
...will you do me the honor of
becomingZoey Hyde-Tottingham Pierce Schmidt?

84
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,920
No. I'm sorry.I can't do it.

85
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,550
Zoey!

86
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,670
Shut up,Bolton!

87
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,030
So,after they get married,

88
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,980
I don't know what I'm going to do.

89
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,050
Oh,Alan,don't be coy.

90
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,330
If you want to come
live with me,just ask.

91
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,710
Can I come live with you?

92
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,510
No.

93
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,410
Come on,Mom,I'm gonna be homeless.

94
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,660
Once he marries her,I'm
gonna be living on the street.

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,580
Try to pick a street in
Beverly Hillsso I can visit you.

96
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,930
Does this guy belong to you?

97
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,820
Michael Bolton?

98
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,890
Hi,Alan.

99
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,370
Uh,yes,bring him in.

100
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
What happened?

101
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,410
She said no.

102
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,850
Oh,oh,Walden,I am so sorry.

103
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,360
When I proposed,she just
ran out of the restaurant.

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,700
Now she won't return my
callsor e-mails or texts.

105
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,210
It's like she's ignoring meacross
the entire digital spectrum.

106
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,810
It's like she's Amish.

107
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,930
So...you went out drinking

108
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,100
and ended up picking up Michael Bolton?

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,030
No.I hired him to sing
while I was proposing.

110
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,570
I should've gone with Josh Groban.

111
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,700
Wait,you're gonna blame me for this?

112
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,810
I'm gonna call her again.

113
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,170
Oh,my stars.Michael Bolton.

114
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,020
I have a vibrator named after you.

115
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,460
Zoey,why won't you
answer?Was it something I did?

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Was the ring not big
enough?Was it Bolton?

117
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,790
Hey!

118
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,400
Okay.Screw it,I just
can't sit around here.

119
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,050
Come on,Bolton,let's go find her.

120
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,740
I'm not gonna go looking
for your girlfriend.

121
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,140
Why don't you see if Groban's available?

122
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,330
Hey,I bought and paid
for your ass until 10:00.

123
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,560
It's 10:01.So now you can kiss it.

124
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,380
Fine,I'll just drive myself.

125
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,480
Oh,no,no,hang on,hang on.
You can't drive.I'll take you.

126
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,740
See,you're a good
friend.You're dead to me.

127
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,850
I can't believe the
things I do for money.

128
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,330
You won't believe the
things I'll do for free.

129
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,200
I really,really think you ought
to waittill tomorrow to do this.

130
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,190
No,no,I need to know why.

131
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,360
Not a good idea.

132
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,900
See,it's like asking a woman
why she won't sleep with you.

133
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,750
You always hope that
it's 'cause you're too big

134
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,360
and you'll ruin her for other men.

135
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,990
But no,it's usually 'cause she
sobered upand got a good look at you.

136
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,280
Oh,Walden.

137
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,690
That's the sound they make.

138
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,650
We need to talk.

139
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,940
Can we do this tomorrow?

140
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,670
Let me use a word that
you're fond of:"No."

141
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,590
Have you been drinking?

142
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,050
Let me use a word that
you're not fond of:"Yes."

143
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,140
She's right,Walden. You
can come back tomorrow.

144
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,070
No. I'm not leaving
until I get an answer.

145
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,540
Walden,please.

146
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,780
Zoey,I need an answer.

147
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,450
Oh,it's complicated.

148
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,800
No.

149
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,070
Peeing with morning wood is complicated.

150
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,700
True. That thing is like a Water Wiggle.

151
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,130
Once,I shorted out a light
socket in the ceiling.

152
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,520
- I've done that.
- Yeah.

153
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,920
Saying yes to someone who
loves youmore than life itself

154
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,680
is not complicated.

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,680
Fine. Do you really want to know?

156
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
I really want to know.

157
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,780
Oh,hang on,hang on. Okay,okay.

158
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,580
This is a textbook exampleof
what I was talking about earlier.

159
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,250
When a woman says,"Do
you really want to know?"

160
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,840
you think you want to know,but trust me,

161
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,890
you don't really want to know.

162
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,300
No,I really want to know.

163
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,430
There's someone else.

164
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,700
You're right.I did not want to know.

165
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,020
It's someone I was involved
with many years ago,

166
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,940
and he's having a
very,very rough time and...

167
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,020
and he needs me.

168
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,140
Oh.Well,that clears it up.

169
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,670
Hey,if you like hanging outwith
guys who are down on their luck,

170
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,520
why don't you just shack
up with my loser friend?

171
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,760
Um,I'm actually not available.

172
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,700
Wait a minute,there's another guy?

173
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,820
Yep.

174
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,580
Better than Walden?

175
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,150
Apparently.

176
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm sorry,unless this new
guy can fly around the room

177
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,700
and shoot fire out his
ass,that bitch is crazy.

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,790
Hey.

179
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,450
Well,hey,look who's finally
up.How you feeling,buddy?

180
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,050
A little hungover.

181
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,990
Berta,you got any pot brownies?

182
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,810
Until they cure glaucoma.

183
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Thanks.

184
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,730
You want a glass of milkor
something to wash that down with?

185
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,940
No,I'm good. Thanks.

186
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,210
Instead of getting loaded,maybe
you want to talk about it?

187
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,920
What is there to talk about,Alan?

188
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,890
She's with another guy!

189
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,780
I changed my mind about the milk.

190
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,110
I mean,how can another
guy give her anything

191
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,530
that I can't give her?

192
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,870
Maybe he doesn't talk
with his mouth full.

193
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,940
You know what?I don't think
the other guy can give her

194
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,470
anything I can't.

195
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,640
Well,you're probably right.

196
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,140
Probably?

197
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,050
Definitely!

198
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,730
You know what? Let's just make a list.

199
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,950
Okay,here we go. Look at this.

200
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,690
Walden... and the other
guy.Let's just call him "Dick."

201
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,250
Okay.Ability to
provide.Walden-- billionaire.

202
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,330
Dick? Less.

203
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,690
That's one point for me.Okay,looks.

204
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,000
You win.

205
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,060
Thank you,Berta.

206
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,840
I didn't want to say so myself.

207
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,670
Oh! Humility.That's
two more checks for me.

208
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,300
Okay,what else? Oh,just
an all-around great guy.

209
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,790
Everybody likes me.Who likes Dick?

210
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,720
- Um... 
- Berta,please.

211
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,160
Oh,God.Zoey likes Dick.

212
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,160
Who am I kidding?Zoey loves Dick!

213
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,430
Oh,hey,hey.Take it easy.

214
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,970
I miss her,Alan.I miss
the way she looks at me.

215
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,260
Yeah.

216
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,660
Her smile.

217
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,410
Sure,sure.

218
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,910
Her hair.

219
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,090
Her cute little butt.

220
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,880
Hello,sailor.

221
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,850
Just the way our bodies
just fit perfectly together.

222
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,170
Damn,I should've hugged him.

223
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,050
Trust me,buddy,a stranger in your bed

224
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,860
is not gonna chase
away the memory of Zoey.

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,390
What do you suggest I do?

226
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,600
Well,what usually helps me is
a bottle of supermarket vodka

227
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,680
and masturbating using
my tears as lubricant.

228
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,970
So I'm just supposed to
accept being alone forever?

229
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,480
Hey,you will never be alonebecause
I will never leave you.

230
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,880
- Thanks.
- Can't get rid of me.

231
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,670
I'm like a dry cough.

232
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,760
Yeah,you might be onto something.

233
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,340
Maybe I should just give up women.

234
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,930
We should go gay!

235
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,790
Good one.

236
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,700
But no,I'm serious.

237
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,940
Really?

238
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,360
Okay,okay,if we're gonna
do it,we got to do it right.

239
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,620
We'll get married in New
Hampshire,uh,register at Pottery Barn,

240
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,490
adopt a Chinese baby.

241
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,140
Ooh,we can wear scarves at our wedding!

242
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,400
You would look great in a scarf.

243
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,940
It hides the turkey neck.

244
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,900
We live together,we like each
other,we're halfway there.

245
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,670
Sure,sure. Mailman
already thinks we're gay.

246
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,780
Yeah,he does.

247
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,260
At night,we could sit out on the
deckand grill up a couple steaks.

248
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,390
Steaks? Who are we kidding? Seared ahi.

249
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,160
Oh,better. Maybe some couscous?

250
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,860
- I love couscous! 
- Yeah!

251
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,540
Then,after dinner,we could
go inside and watch the game.

252
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,640
Or if the game's a blowout,we
switch to Project Runway.

253
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,850
Yeah! Yeah,what do you think?

254
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,360
Mr. and Mr. Walden Schmidt.

255
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,800
So I would take your name?
Why wouldn't we take my name?

256
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,370
'Cause I'm the breadwinner.

257
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,800
So you think making a home isn't work?

258
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,980
I am sorry.We'll hyphenate.

259
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,870
- Schmidt-Harper.-
Harper-Schmidt.

260
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,630
Fine.

261
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,240
I'll order the towels.

262
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,860
So,listen,um,would we be
having sex like guys do?

263
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,380
I would.You'd be having
sex more like a woman does.

264
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,330
- Hmm.
- Problem?

265
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,380
No,I'm open to it. No pun intended.

266
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,800
But?

267
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,320
Look,I'm willing to
take one for the team;

268
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,020
it's just... if this doesn't work out,

269
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,540
I'd have to know I'm
gonna be provided for.

270
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,090
What is that supposed to mean?

271
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,980
It means I'm not signing a prenup.

272
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,290
Excuse me,is this seat taken?

273
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,360
No,help yourself.

274
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,110
Thanks.

275
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,150
Yo,forget what I said
about giving up women.

276
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,060
No,yeah,I was just goofin'.

277
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,370
I'm Walden.

278
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,100
So close.

279
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,620
I told you I had a big backyard.

280
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,170
You didn't tell me it was so... wet.

281
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,330
Yeah,I got to get my sprinklers checked.

282
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,970
This happens every day.

283
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,430
Are you okay?

284
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,810
Yeah,I think so.

285
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,380
No,I don't think so.

286
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,540
Um,are you as high as I am?

287
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,860
I'm pretty baked.

288
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,810
You're also pretty pretty.

289
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,550
Are you ready to get freaky?

290
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,240
I am way ahead of you.

291
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,020
You must think I'm awfully easy.

292
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,850
No,I think you're wonderfully easy.

293
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,810
Uh-oh,here we go again.

294
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,630
I didn't expect anything like this
to happenwhen I went to a bar alone

295
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,360
in a short skirt and no underwear.

296
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,680
Ah,geez.

297
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,420
What's the matter?

298
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,850
Nothing. I...I'm just
coming out of a bad breakup,

299
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,640
so I'm a little shaky.

300
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,980
That's okay.

301
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,610
I know how to make you forget her.

302
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,220
You still thinking
about your girlfriend?

303
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,710
No.It's my ex-wife this time.

304
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,240
Okay. Let's try again.

305
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,000
Mommy!

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,210
Mommy?

307
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,830
Okay... Daddy.

308
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,630
Can we just hold on for a second?

309
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,910
Am I doing something wrong?

310
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,750
No,no.I,um...I might
just be a little too high.

311
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,800
Okay,let's slow it down.
I got nowhere to be.

312
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,040
Great.

313
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,400
I could kiss you all night long.

314
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,300
I could have made him scream like that.

315
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,480
I'm really sorry.

316
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,770
Me,too.

317
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,740
I don't usually mistake
the women I'm sleeping with

318
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,460
for adult contemporary pop artists.

319
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,760
That's new.

320
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,010
I need air.

321
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,240
All right,no pot for a while.

322
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,510
Oh,bull dunny.

323
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,390
It wasn't the pot.

324
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,150
Would you please just
get out of my head?

325
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,760
Yelling's not gonna solve
your problems,Walden.

326
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,990
Oh,damn it.

327
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,810
Women leaving,that's your problem.

328
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,410
Not right now,it isn't!

329
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,540
It was my fault,really.

330
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,040
Oh,great.

331
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,550
I was the first to abandon him.

332
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,440
Oh,you didn't abandon
him; you had a career.

333
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,540
Tell him that.

334
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,210
Would,uh... just all of
you just leave me alone?!

335
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,680
Go away,I tell you! Go away!

336
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,270
No way I'm signing a prenup.

337
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,670
You know what? Just get out of my head!

338
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,190
All of you,just leave me alone!
